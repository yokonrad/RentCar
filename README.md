# RentCar

â€‹1. First decision which i had to make was about using a proper architecture for whole web app. I decided to use an onion architecture due to separation of layers. It is easy to modify and expand for further functionality.
2. Next step was projecting database scheme. This time it was kinda easy because we had to store data in only three tables - cars, locations and reservations. I decided to create a database using Entity Framework because i had to create entities for the other part of application anyway. Further database operations are made with Dapper because i like to have a control on my queries.
3. I made whole backend like proper repositores, controllers and views to make a crud operations on all data from the tables.
4. Later i've implemented simple UI theme and functionality to make a reservations on home page.

TODO:
- Next step should me implementing authentitication handlers to hide admin functionality (like crud operations on tables) and rethink about client/server side validations.
